"""Long-form PRO narratives ("The Long Read").

The free narrative sells the day; this sells the subscription. Every event gets a
second, longer piece — chapters, a timeline, the myth-correction, the aftermath and
real sources — that only PRO users ever receive in full.

Two rules shape the whole module:

1. **It must not repeat the free narrative.** A subscriber reading both should feel
   they got a second article, not a padded version of the first. `_overlap_ratio`
   enforces that mechanically; the prompt asks for it explicitly.

2. **English is generated, the rest is translated.** Generating 2,000 words natively
   in five languages would multiply the daily token bill by five and let the facts
   drift between languages. Instead English gets reasoning tokens (this is dense
   factual writing, unlike the creative short narrative) and the other four are
   translated from it — the same trade `AIProcessor._patch_from_english` already makes.

You are writing the long-form piece for subscribers of a history app — the kind of
article someone reads to the end on a Sunday morning and then tells someone about.
ONE event. {TARGET_WORDS}-2400 words total across all chapters. Write in English.

EVENT: {year} — {text}
WIKIPEDIA: {slug}
DATE: {date_str}, {year}
LOCATION: {location}
{avoid_block}
WHAT TO PRODUCE:

1. CHAPTERS — {MIN_CHAPTERS} to {MAX_CHAPTERS} of them, each with a real title and at least
   {MIN_CHAPTER_WORDS} words. Titles are hooks, not labels: "The Order That Was Never Sent",
   not "Background". Each chapter does distinct work — set-up, mechanism, the moment,
   the people, the consequence. Never summarize the previous chapter.

2. HIGHLIGHTS — {MIN_HIGHLIGHTS} to {MAX_HIGHLIGHTS} points of interest, read BEFORE the article as
   the reason to bother with it. Each is {{"label": "...", "text": "..."}}: a 2-5 word label
   and 25-45 words under it. One concrete fact, number, name or scene each — never a
   summary of the chapter it came from.

   THE LABELS DEPEND ON WHAT KIND OF EVENT THIS IS. Choose them yourself to fit the
   subject; do not reuse a fixed set. What a reader wants to know about a person is not
   what they want to know about a treaty. For example:

   • A PERSON (born, died, or the subject) — what they actually did, in one line. What
     they are genuinely known for, as opposed to what they are misremembered for. The
     thing about them almost nobody knows. What was left behind.
   • A RELIGIOUS OR DOCTRINAL EVENT — what was actually decided or happened on the day.
     Who was in the room and who was excluded. What changed the following morning. What
     is still being argued about because of it.
   • A BATTLE, DISASTER OR CATASTROPHE — the scale in real numbers. The decision that
     made it go this way rather than another. The detail that makes it human. Who paid.
   • A TREATY, LAW OR FOUNDING — what problem it was supposed to solve. What it actually
     did. Who won and who lost, named. Whether it held.
   • A DISCOVERY, INVENTION OR FIRST — what existed before it and did not after. How it
     actually worked, in plain words. Who else nearly got there first.

   Those are illustrations, not a menu. A coronation, a premiere, a heist and an
   expedition each want their own labels. Write the labels this event deserves.

3. TIMELINE — 5 to 12 entries, each "MARKER — what happened". The marker is a real time,
   date or year ("14:32", "3 March 1848", "Spring 1919"). Tight, factual, sequential.
   This is the spine of the event, not a repeat of the chapters.

4. MISCONCEPTION — 80-150 words on what most people get wrong about this event. The
   popular version, then what actually happened, and why the wrong version stuck.
   If there is genuinely no popular misconception, write instead about the detail that
   is consistently left out of the retellings.

5. AFTERMATH — 3 to 4 entries tracing consequences forward in time. Each begins with a
   time marker ("Within a decade", "By 1961", "Two centuries later"). Concrete effects
   on real people, institutions or places — not "it changed history".

6. SOURCES — {MIN_SOURCES} to 5 real references as "Author, Title (Year)". Books, papers,
   archives, published collections. NEVER invent a source. NEVER output a URL. If you
   are not confident a specific work exists, name the archive or the primary document
   type instead ("the Admiralty logs held at Kew").

HOW TO WRITE IT:
- Real numbers as evidence, woven into sentences. "Of the 300 who went in, 11 walked out."
- Name real people. Quote them only when you know the actual words.
- Explain mechanisms in plain language — the engineering, the law, the politics.
  The explanation should be the most satisfying part, never a chore.
- Dry, intelligent irony where the material earns it. A genuinely funny line once or
  twice in the whole piece, never forced onto tragedy.
- Vary paragraph and sentence length. If a sentence is boring, cut it.
- No headers inside chapter bodies. Paragraphs separated by blank lines.

BANNED PHRASES:
"it is worth noting" / "history tells us" / "changed the course of history" /
"left an indelible mark" / "without a doubt" / "subsequently" / "in conclusion" /
"serves as a reminder" / "stands as a testament" / "little did they know" /
"on this day" / "fast forward" / "needless to say" / "in this article".
